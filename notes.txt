=== The bootloader ===
When the computer turns on, a bunch of initialization stuff happens. Peripherals are identified, finds buses available, etc. The thing we are interested in is the BIOS

-- BIOS ---
* A bios is a special program that is embedded in BIOS chip
* Upon boot, the bios program is loaded into the CPU, and begins the bootstrapping process of getting the system ready to do higher level stuff.
* Call this boot-stage-0
* The end of this process involves finding a bootable device, i.e a device that contains a boot sector

--- BOOT SECTOR ---
* The first 512 bytes of a bootable disk is called the bootsector or the Master Boot Record.
* The last word of the sector must contain the signature 0xAA55

--- THE BOOT PROCESS ---
* The bios will search for and intialize available storage media, then decide which of these to boot from. (look for 0xAA55) signature.

--- Assembly ---
*.asm is the assembly file extension
- registers -
*AX - accumulator usually used in input and output and arithmatic
*BX - base register used in indexed addressing
*CX - count register, used to store loop count in iterative sections
*DX - data register

*index registers

*SI - source index for a string operation
*DI - destination index
